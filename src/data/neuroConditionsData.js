      heroIntro: `
Stroke is a serious neurological condition caused by an interruption in blood supply
to the brain, resulting in damage to brain tissue. It often leads to physical,
sensory, cognitive, and speech impairments. Early, structured, and goal-oriented
physiotherapy plays a critical role in maximizing neurological recovery and improving
quality of life.
  `,

      overview: `
A stroke may occur due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the
brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Depending on the area and severity of brain involvement,
patients may experience paralysis, weakness, speech difficulties, balance loss, or
cognitive impairments.

Stroke rehabilitation is not limited to regaining movement alone—it focuses on helping
individuals relearn daily activities, improve independence, and adapt to life after
stroke through evidence-based neuro-rehabilitation strategies.
  `,

      commonSymptoms: [
        "Sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the body",
        "Difficulty in walking, balance, and coordination",
        "Speech and swallowing difficulties",
        "Loss of sensation or numbness",
        "Visual disturbances",
        "Memory, attention, or cognitive deficits",
        "Emotional changes such as anxiety or depression",
      ],

      whyPhysiotherapyIsImportant: `
Physiotherapy is essential after stroke because the brain has the ability to reorganize
itself—a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Through repetitive, task-specific
training and guided movement practice, physiotherapy helps the brain form new neural
connections, enabling recovery of lost functions.

many individuals continue to improve months or even years after stroke. Long-term
rehabilitation focuses on maintaining gains, preventing regression, and promoting
active participation in daily and social activities.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) occurs when an external force causes damage to the brain,
leading to temporary or permanent impairments in physical, cognitive, emotional, and
behavioral functions. Early and structured neuro-rehabilitation plays a vital role in
optimizing recovery and improving long-term outcomes.
  `,

      overview: `
TBI can result from road traffic accidents, falls, sports injuries, assaults, or other
traumatic events. Depending on the severity and area of injury, individuals may
experience difficulties with movement, balance, speech, memory, attention, and
emotional regulation.

Neuro-physiotherapy focuses on retraining the brain and body to work together again

      whyPhysiotherapyIsImportant: `
